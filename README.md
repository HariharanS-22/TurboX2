**Turbo X2** is a dual-mode robotic system, combining the vertical flight capabilities of a bicopter with the stability and control of a self-balancing bot. This hybrid robot can switch seamlessly between aerial and ground modes using an RC transmitter (Flysky i6) , making it versatile for real-world terrain and tactical operations.
